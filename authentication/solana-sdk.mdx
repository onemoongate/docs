## Take-off Safety Procedures Before we accelerate, let's check if you&#39;re
ready to go. - Please ensure you are using the Solana Labs Wallet adapter in
your dApp. - This SDK is built for React based projects only. If you are looking
to implement using another stack, talk to our staff on Discord. - If you are
using a custom wallet adapter instead of the Solana Labs Wallet Adapter - speak
to a member of our staff on Discord and we will custom cater our integration for
you.

## Let&#39;s roll

Alright, we&#39;re ready to start integrating!

### 1. On your frontend, install the dependencies using npm.

```javascript
npm i @moongate/wallet-wrapper-sdk @moongate/moongate-adapter @moongate/solana-wallet-sdk
```

### 2. Navigate to your Solana Labs wallet adapter where the wallets are defined.

It should look something like this:

```javascript
const wallets = useMemo(
  () => [new UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter()],
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  [network]
);
```

Then, import the wallet adapter from the top of the file like follows:

```javascript
import { MoongateWalletAdapter } from "@moongate/moongate-adapter";
```

Next, instantiate an instance of the wallet adapter within the wallets declaration like follows:

```javascript
const wallets = useMemo(
  () => [
    new UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter(),
    new MoongateWalletAdapter(), // just add this line
  ],
  [network]
);
```

### 3. Navigate to where your Wallet Adapter Connection button is defined.

It is usually called WalletMultiButton - or similar.

```javascript
<WalletMultiButton /> // this is what it usually looks like
```

At the top of where this button is defined, call the following imports

```javascript
import { AuthModal } from "@moongate/wallet-wrapper-sdk";
import {
  WalletMultiButton,
  WalletDisconnectButton,
  useWalletModal,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui";
import { useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
```

Next, add the following hooks to the main function component of where you want to define the button.

```javascript
const { select, connected } = useWallet();
const { visible, setVisible } = useWalletModal();
```

Then, replace the existing button with this:

```javascript
<AuthModal select={select} connected={connected} setVisible={setVisible} />
```

That's it. Quick and easy. You're ready to go! That's all it took to start accepting Ethereum users on your dApp!

## Customisation

### Customising the wallet pop-up position

You can customise the position of the wallet pop-up by passing in the following props to the adapter with the following list of options:

```
top-left
top-right
bottom-left
bottom-right
```

```javascript
const wallets = useMemo(
  () => [
    new UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter(),
    new MoongateWalletAdapter({ position: "top-right" }), // you can choose the location by passing in the prop here
  ],
  [network]
);
```

### Customising the button

You can customise the button by passing in the following props:

```javascript
<AuthModal
  select={select}
  connected={connected}
  setVisible={setVisible}
  btnStyles={"btn-red"}
/>
```

The btnStyles prop takes in a string that you can use to customize the button. You can define your own styles in your CSS file and pass in the class name here.

### Customizing the modal

You can customize the modal by passing in the following props:

```javascript
<AuthModal
  select={select}
  connected={connected}
  setVisible={setVisible}
  modalStyles={"modal-red"}
/>
```

The modalStyles prop takes in a string that you can use to customize the modal. You can define your own styles in your CSS file and pass in the class name here.

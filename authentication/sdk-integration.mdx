### Requirements
Take-off Safety Procedures Before we accelerate, let's check if you&#39;re ready to go. 
Please ensure you are using the Solana Labs Wallet adapter in
your dApp. - This SDK is built for React based projects only. If you are looking
to implement using another stack, talk to our staff on Discord. - If you are
using a custom wallet adapter instead of the Solana Labs Wallet Adapter - speak
to a member of our staff on Discord and we will custom cater our integration for
you.

### How to Integrate full SDK:

Alright, we&#39;re ready to start integrating!

#### Step 1
On your frontend, install the dependencies using npm.

```javascript
npm i @moongate/google-button @moongate/moongate-adapter
```

#### Step 2
Navigate to your Solana Labs wallet adapter where the wallets are defined.

It should look something like this:

```javascript
const wallets = useMemo(
  () => [new UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter()],
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  [network]
);
```

Then, import the wallet adapter from the top of the file like follows:

```javascript
import { registerMoonGateWallet } from "@moongate/moongate-adapter";
```

Next, instantiate the wallet adapter within the wallets declaration like follows:

```javascript
registerMoonGateWallet({ authMode: "Ethereum", position: "top-left", logoDataUri: "OPTIONAL ADD IN-WALLET LOGO URL HERE", buttonLogoUri: "ADD OPTIONAL LOGO FOR WIDGET BUTTON HERE" })
registerMoonGateWallet({ authMode: "Google", position: "top-right", logoDataUri: "OPTIONAL ADD IN-WALLET LOGO URL HERE", buttonLogoUri: "ADD OPTIONAL LOGO FOR WIDGET BUTTON HERE" })
registerMoonGateWallet({ authMode: "Twitter", position: "top-right", logoDataUri: "OPTIONAL ADD IN-WALLET LOGO URL HERE", buttonLogoUri: "ADD OPTIONAL LOGO FOR WIDGET BUTTON HERE" })
registerMoonGateWallet({ authMode: "Apple", position: "top-right", logoDataUri: "OPTIONAL ADD IN-WALLET LOGO URL HERE", buttonLogoUri: "ADD OPTIONAL LOGO FOR WIDGET BUTTON HERE" })
// just above the wallets memo
const wallets = useMemo(
  () => [
    new UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter(),
  ],
  [network]
);
```

#### Step 3
Navigate to where your Wallet Adapter Connection button is defined.

It is usually called WalletMultiButton - or similar.

```javascript
<WalletMultiButton /> // this is what it usually looks like
```

At the top of where this button is defined, call the following imports

```javascript
import { Button } from "@moongate/google-button";
import {
  WalletMultiButton,
  WalletDisconnectButton,
  useWalletModal,
} from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui";
import { useWallet } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react";
```

Next, add the following hooks to the main function component of where you want to define the button.

```javascript
const { select, connected } = useWallet();
const { visible, setVisible } = useWalletModal();
```

Then, replace the existing button with this:

```javascript
<Button select={select} connected={connected} setVisible={setVisible} text="JOIN" />

```

That's it. Quick and easy. You're ready to go! That's all it took to anti-noob your dApp.

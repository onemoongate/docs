### Requirements
Take-off Safety Procedures Before we accelerate, let's check if you&#39;re ready to go. 
Please ensure you are using the Solana Labs Wallet adapter in
your dApp. - This SDK is built for projects utilising the Solana Labs Wallet Adapter. If you are looking
to implement using another stack, talk to our staff on Discord. - If you are
using a custom wallet adapter instead of the Solana Labs Wallet Adapter - speak
to a member of our staff on Discord and we will custom cater our integration for
you.

### How to Integrate full SDK:

Alright, we&#39;re ready to start integrating!

#### Step 1
On your frontend, install the dependencies using npm.

```javascript
npm i @moongate/moongate-adapter
```

#### Step 2
Navigate to your Solana Labs wallet adapter where the wallets are defined.

It should look something like this:

```javascript
const wallets = useMemo(
  () => [new UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter()],
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  [network]
);
```
#### Step 3
Then, import the wallet adapter from the top of the file like follows:

```javascript
import { registerMoonGateWallet } from "@moongate/moongate-adapter";
```

Then just add the Wallet Adapter above the wallets memo like this, you can change the order the wallets by changing the order of the registerMoonGateWallet functions:

```javascript
registerMoonGateWallet({ authMode: "Ethereum", position: "top-left", logoDataUri: "OPTIONAL ADD IN-WALLET LOGO URL HERE", buttonLogoUri: "ADD OPTIONAL LOGO FOR WIDGET BUTTON HERE" })
registerMoonGateWallet({ authMode: "Google", position: "top-right", logoDataUri: "OPTIONAL ADD IN-WALLET LOGO URL HERE", buttonLogoUri: "ADD OPTIONAL LOGO FOR WIDGET BUTTON HERE" })
registerMoonGateWallet({ authMode: "Twitter", position: "top-right", logoDataUri: "OPTIONAL ADD IN-WALLET LOGO URL HERE", buttonLogoUri: "ADD OPTIONAL LOGO FOR WIDGET BUTTON HERE" })
registerMoonGateWallet({ authMode: "Apple", position: "top-right", logoDataUri: "OPTIONAL ADD IN-WALLET LOGO URL HERE", buttonLogoUri: "ADD OPTIONAL LOGO FOR WIDGET BUTTON HERE" })
const wallets = useMemo(
  () => [
    new UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter(),
  ],
  [network]
);
```

The modalStyles prop takes in a string that you can use to customize the modal. You can define your own styles in your CSS file and pass in the class name here.
## Customisation

### Customising the wallet pop-up position

You can customise the position of the wallet pop-up by passing in the following props to the adapter with the following list of options:

```
top-left
top-right
bottom-left
bottom-right
```

```javascript
registerMoonGateWallet({ authMode: "Ethereum", position: "top-left", logoDataUri: "OPTIONAL ADD IN-WALLET LOGO URL HERE", buttonLogoUri: "ADD OPTIONAL LOGO FOR WIDGET BUTTON HERE" })
const wallets = useMemo(
  () => [
    new UnsafeBurnerWalletAdapter(),
  ],
  [network]
);
```
